This sample shows how to create a bot that uses Rich Cards. This bot example uses [`restify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify) and [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). 

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, 
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/06.using-cards
    ```
- [Optional] Update the .env file under samples/javascript_nodejs/06.using-cards with your botFileSecret
    For Azure Bot Service bots, you can find the botFileSecret under application settings.
- Install modules and start the bot
    ```bash
    npm i && npm start
    ```
    Alternatively you can also use nodemon via
    ```bash
    npm i && npm run watch
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to samples/javascript_nodejs/06.using-cards folder
- Select using-cards.bot file

# Rich Cards
A key to good bot design is to send interactive media, such as Rich Cards. There are several different types of Rich Cards, which are as follows:

- Animation Card
- Audio Card
- Hero Card
- Receipt Card
- Signin Card
- Thumbnail Card
- Video Card

When [designing the user experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-user-experience?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#cards) developers should consider adding visual elements such as Rich Cards.

# Deploy this bot to Azure
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. 

To install all Bot Builder tools - 

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.5 or higher

```bash
npm i -g msbot chatdown ludown qnamaker luis-apis botdispatch luisgen
```

To clone this bot, run
```
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id>
```
