This sample shows how to use the prompts classes included in `botbuilder-dialogs`. This bot will ask for the user's name, then store the response. It demonstrates a 2-step dialog flow using a prompt, as well as using the state accessors to store and retrieve values.

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/04.simple-prompt`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/04.simple-prompt
    ```
- Install modules and start the bot
    ```bash
    npm i && npm start
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to `samples/javascript_nodejs/04.simple-prompt-bot`
- Select `simple-prompt-bot.bot` file

# Deploy this bot to Azure
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. In order to install this and other tools, you can read [Installing CLI Tools](../../../Installing_CLI_tools.md).

To clone this bot, run
```bash
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id>
```

# Prompts

A conversation between a bot and a user often involves asking (prompting) the user for information, parsing the user's response, and then acting on that information. This sample demonstrates how to prompt users for information using the different prompt types included in the [botbuilder-dialogs](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder-dialogs) library and supported by the SDK.

The `botbuilder-dialogs` library includes a variety of pre-built prompt classes, including text, number, and datetime types. This sample demonstrates using a single text prompt to collect the user's name. For an example that uses multiple prompts of different types, see [sample 5](../05.multi-turn-prompt/).
