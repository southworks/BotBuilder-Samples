**Windows 10 - How to map a network drive**

**Note:** If you do not know the server and folder path that you need to map to:

1.  Go to http://ops.uhc.com/Tools/DriveMapHistory.aspx.
2.  Enter your MS ID, then Submit.
3.  You will see a list of dates, drive letters and paths previously mapped on your machine. Use this on step 5 below.

To map the drive:

1.  Click **Start**, then type _This PC (_search bar will appear as you type), then select **This PC** from the search results.
2.  Select the **Computer** tab from the menu bar.
3.  Select **Map Network drive** from the ribbon.
4.  Click the the **Drive** dropdown, then select a drive letter for the network folder.
5.  Enter the path to the network folder into the **Folder** text box.
    *   Example: \\\\\unpiox54pn\\\uhg-scanning\\\
    *   If you want this drive to always map when you login, fill the **Reconnect at logon** checkbox.
    *   If you are connecting to a folder on another domain, fill the **Connect using different credentials** checkbox.
        (The format would be _**Domain\\\UserID**_.)
    *   If you are having issues mapping the drive,
        1.  **Ping** the server using cmd
            example: ping server1
        2.  Run **nslookup** on the resulting ip address
            example: nslookup ipaddress
            *   Replace ipaddress with the ip address from the ping command
        3.  Nslookup will return the **fully qualified domain name**.
        4.  Map the folder using the fully qualified domain name
            example: \\\
            as05209pnlif2.uhc.com\\\shared

Click the **Finish** button.

If prompted, enter the appropriate credentials, then click the **OK** button.

The new drive should now be available in the Computer window.
**Note**: If you get an Access Denied error message the folder is restricted and you will need to submit a request for access in Secure.

# ? Member eligibility refresh

```markdown
**Member eligibility refresh**

**Notes:**

*   Eligibility refresh sometimes takes **24-48 hours** so there could be a **delay of 24-48 hours** to have the latest eligibility details for any member in ICUE system.
*   This delay has been agreed upon by the business.

1.  Wait for **48 hours** to get the latest member eligibility details.
    *   After **48 hours**, if latest eligibility data does not appear:
        1.  Contact the Help Desk or open an online ticket with the following details:
            **Important!** Enter **PHI** / **PII** in their respective fields.

            *   Subscriber ID:
            *   First Name:
            *   Last Name:
            *   Date of Birth:
            *   Policy Number:
            *   Name of the Source System (CSP Facets, Cosmos, CES or PHS):
            *   Attach the screenshot of the source system where it is showing as active/termed:
    *   If any documentation in ICUE is required on the member before actual eligibility is received by ICUE:

        1.  Create a **temporary member** in ICUE.
        2.  Continue to document case/program on that temporary member.
        3.  Once permanent member is received by ICUE, **merge** the temporary member with permanent eligibility so that documented details on temporary member are available with permanent eligibility.

**Verify internet connection**

**Validate**:

**Important!** Genesys WWE laptop users must be on a wired / LAN connection.

**Instructions**:

*   Perform a full system cycle (power cycling the computer, modem and router):
    *   Computer:
        1.  Log out of Genesys.
        2.  Close all open applications.
        3.  Shut down the computer.
        4.  While it is powered down, undock and re-dock the computer.

# ? Perform power cycle

```markdown
**Perform power cycle**

**Note:** You may not have all of the equipment listed below (example: modem or router). Skip any step that does not apply to your network setup.

1.  Shut down the computer.

    1.  Save and close all running applications and documents.
    2.  Click **Start** > **Shutdown**.
2.  Power off the network hardware.
    *   **Important!** Never press the reset button on a modem or router as this will reset the device to factory settings.
    *   **Power off** the router using the power switch or by removing the power cable.
    *   **Power off** the internet modem.

        *   If you are using a cable internet provider, **unscrew** the coaxial cable from the modem.
3.  Keep all equipment powered off for **five minutes**.
    *   **Note:** It is recommended to power off the equipment for a full **five minutes** to cause the connection to reset itself at the (Internet Service Provider) ISP. Powering off for less than 5 minutes might not allow enough time to accomplish this reset.
    *   If you are using a WAH Kit Cisco Router and you use a USB headset for calls, bypass the Cisco router so that you're connecting the computer directly to the internet modem and ask your team's BSL to get a box with a pre-paid label sent to you so that you can return the WAH Kit. Otherwise, if you're using a physical phone as part of the WAH Kit, during the 5-minute wait, you can [verify all appropriate cables](https://ssuniversal.uhc.com/UKS_attach/sw_images/wah%20kit%20hardware%20vpn/cabling.pdf) are plugged in securely.
        *   **Note:** Follow this [knowledge](https://optum.service-now.com/hc?id=itss_hc_kb_article_max_view&sysparm_article=KB0096313) on how to locate your Business Segment Liaison (BSL).
4.  **Power on** the modem and wait for it to start up.

    *   If there is a router, power it on and wait for it to start up.
    *   If there is a coaxial cable, reconnect it the to the modem.
5.  **Power on** the computer and test.
6.  If the steps above did not resolve the issue, attempt a power reset.

    *   **Disconnect** computer from the docking station or the power source.
    *   **Press** and **hold** the power button for at least **30 seconds**.
    *   **Reconnect** computer to power source or dock.
    *   **Press** the power button again to restart.
    *   **Test** for resolution.

# ? Perform power cycle

```markdown
**Perform power cycle**

**Overview:**

Power cycling is different from a general restart. Power cycling refers to the act of turning a device or piece of electrical or electronic equipment off, or otherwise disconnecting it from its power source, and then turning it back on again.

**Instructions:**

**Note:** You may not have all of the equipment listed below (example: modem or router). Skip any step that does not apply to your network setup.

*   Shut down the computer.
    *   Save and close all running applications and documents.
    *   Click Windows **Start** menu > **Power** icon > **Shutdown**.
*   Power off the network hardware.
    *   **Important!** Do **not** press the reset button on the modem or router as this will reset the device to factory settings.
    *   **Power off** the router using the power button or by removing the power cable.
    *   **Power off** the internet modem.
        *   If you are using a cable internet provider, **unscrew** the coaxial cable from the modem.
*   Keep all equipment powered off for **five minutes**.
    *   **Notes:**
        *   It is recommended to power off the equipment for full **five minutes** to reset the connection at the Internet Service Provider (ISP.) Powering off for less than five minutes might not allow enough time to accomplish the reset.
        *   If you are using a Work At Home (WAH) kit Cisco router and use a USB headset for calls, bypass the Cisco router to connect the computer directly into the modem. [Reach out to your Business Segment Liaison (BSL)](https://optum.service-now.com/hc?id=itss_hc_kb_article_max_view&sysparm_article=KBB0044750) to get a box with a prepaid label sent and return the WAH kit. Otherwise, if you're using a physical phone as part of the WAH Kit, during the 5-minute wait, [verify all appropriate cables](https://ssuniversal.uhc.com/UKS_attach/sw_images/wah%20kit%20hardware%20vpn/cabling.pdf) are securely plugged in.
*   **Power on** the modem and wait for it to start up.
    *   If there is a router, power it on and wait for it to start up.
    *   If there is a coaxial cable, reconnect it the to the modem.
*   **Power on** the computer.

# ? Connect to new gateway

```markdown
**Connect to new gateway**

*   Launch Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client from the system tray.
*   Click the drop down menu.
*   Select any of the gateways.
*   Click **Connect**.

**Note:** If using a cellular internet service or a cable / DSL provider in a remote / rural location far from a major city, you might be experiencing issues where the distances from the Internet providers (Hub) is giving less than optimal download quality to move data units through. The 81. VPN Support (Cellular) gateway is configured with lowered maximum transmittable units to ease the connection to VPN so it can stay stable in these conditions.

*   US domestic employees including US ITSD can use **81. VPN Support (Cellular)** gateway in Cisco AnyConnect if experiencing connectivity issues.
*   The 81. VPN Support (cellular) auto connects just like the 10. Auto VPN.
*   This is useful for anyone having less than optimal download speeds from domestic US ISP.
*   This is only applicable to US employees.
    *   Launch Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client from the system tray.
    *   Select **81. VPN Support (Cellular)** from the dropdown.

# ? Request email change or second address

```markdown
**Request email change or second address**

**Validation:**

The primary e-mail address for a mailbox (Personal Mailbox or Group mailbox) is the address that appears in the address book. A mailbox can only have one primary Address and it has to be unique to any other address for accurate delivery of emails. Your primary internet address is initially setup when your mailbox is created but you can change it by using the below instructions. Please note that the current primary address will become a secondary address of the mailbox when the request is completed.

**Instructions:**

**Note:** A secondary email address is an address that belongs to a mailbox (Personal Mailbox or Group Mailbox), but doesn't appear in the Outlook Address Book. Any emails sent to that address are delivered to the mailbox the same way as an email sent to the primary address.

*   Determine whether the email address you want to change is the primary address or a secondary address.
    *   Open a new email in Outlook.
    *   Enter your name on the **To:** line as if to send an email to yourself and press Ctrl-K. The name should resolve.
    *   Hover over the name and select the **Options** icon.
    *   Click on **Outlook Properties**.
    *   Select the **E-mail Addresses** tab.
    *   Look for the SMTP address that you want to change.
        *   **Note:** The _SMTP_ with the capital letters is the primary email address. The _smtp_'s with the lower case letters are the secondary addresses.
*   Open the [Email Services Request Portal](https://optum.service-now.com/euts_intake?id=euts_catalog_category&sys_id=a18d8b2bdb6f5304ea7169c3ca9619a4).
*   Select **Email Change.**
*   Choose whether you are processing for yourself or on behalf of another person.
    *   If you are submitting on behalf of another person, enter their employee number in the Employee ID field and press Submit.
*   Select the employee's MS ID that you wish to change the email address for.
    *   You will only be able to select a MS ID that has a mailbox.
*   Select **Add Secondary Email Address** or **Primary Email Address Change** from the Request Type menu.
*   Enter the new email address for the mailbox.
    *   Your new email address must be unique; the request will fail if it is not unique.
    *   Your email address can only have alphanumeric characters, hyphens ( - ) or underscores ( _ ).
*   Select **Submit** to complete the request, please allow 24 hours for the address book to update once the approval is received.

**Misrouted email issues**

**Important!** UHG does not support the use of Rules. Rules can be complex and if created incorrectly, result in the deletion of email which may not be able to be retrieved. Should you decide to create rules, always keep them as simple as possible.

*   You can determine if a rule is causing this problem by disabling any rule you may have created.
    *   With Outlook open click on the **Home** tab, click on the **Rules** icon, and then select **Manage Rules and Alerts**.
*   Alternatively, you can manage your rules using Outlook Online.
    *   Access [Outlook Online](https://outlook.office.com/mail/).
    *   Login with your **MS Domain** credentials if prompted.
        *   **Domain\User name:** MS\User ID
        *   **Password:** Current MS Domain password.
    *   Click **Settings** > **View all Outlook settings** on the upper right corner.
    *   Click **Mail** > **Rules**.
*   Disable any rule you created by unchecking its box.
*   Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.
*   Close, then reopen **Outlook** and test the original issue (for example, ask a co-worker to send you an email, or the same person whose email you are missing...)
*   If you determine that one of your rules is at fault you can leave your rules disabled or attempt to troubleshoot by using the steps below.
    *   Decrease the size of existing rules using any of the following methods:
        *   Shorten the names of the rules:
            *   On the **Tools** menu, click **Rules and Alerts...**
            *   On the **E-mail Rules** tab, click the rule that you want to rename.
            *   In the **Change Rule** list, click **Rename Rule**.
            *   Type a new, shorter name for the rule, and then click **OK**.
            *   Click **OK** to close the **Rules and Alerts** dialog box.
        *   Delete any old rules:
            *   On the **Tools** menu, click **Rules and Alerts...**
            *   On the **E-mail Rules** tab, click the rule that you want to delete.
            *   Click **Delete**, and then click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.
            *   Click **OK** to close the **Rules and Alerts** dialog box.
